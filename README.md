##Wait Stop right there
there is someting u need to know before ging to next section
* English - Don't get offended, there are times when the questions are easy but the problem statement is too large or complex to understand so you need to read a lot. try reading the whole passage carefully and at least try to find what is the objective even when the statement high rated(Difficult). basically develop a reading habbit.
* Typing Speed- You can argue to use templates but you wont get templates if you are giveing a context at some other place where you have no access to you templates. YOu can use these sites
